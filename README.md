**Prerequisites**

1. You must have NodeJS installed.

**Running**

1. Run 'npm install' in the repositories root to make sure that you have all the necessary Node modules installed.
2. Run either './index.js' or 'node index.js' to start the server.
3. Navigate to 'localhost:8080' in your favourite browser to access the website.

**Linting**

Run 'npm run lint' to lint all the files with the '.js' extension which are stored in the 'js/', 'public/js' directories as well as the index.js.

**Email**

The Email receipt will not work out of the box. You will need to open 'js/notify.js' and enter an Email address and password on line 17/20. I have not
created an Email just for this service due to the fact that it is coursework and there is no need for a permanent Email account.
